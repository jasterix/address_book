# contacts_backend
Dotnet backend for contact book
- Simple web api using ASP.Net for the first time. Does basic crud operations with room for improvement

## Still to implement:
### L1
- [ ] Enable CRUD operations independent of GET -> Seeding only happens with getall operation
- [ ] Decide between using ContactService and ContactContext -> currently using 1 methods in CS to seed the getall operation
- [ ] Review routing -> it feels like I may still be mixing up options I've seen in blogs
- [ ] Add basic exception handling for CRUD operations
- [ ] Bolster caching


### L2
- [ ] Create SQL database
- [ ] Seed database with initial contacts
- [ ] Test API endpoints


### L3
- [ ] Auto generate contact IDs
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully

### Questions:

### Handy commands
- `dotnet watch`
- `httprepl \n connect http://127.0.0.1:5240 â€”openapi /swagger/v1/swagger.json`
-
